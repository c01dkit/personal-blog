                    <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-flight&#34;&gt;First flight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The epidemic came to an end and InforSec had its first offline meeting in Shenzhen. Brother Fu Chong was invited to share as a speaker, and we discussed our intention to form a group for the Shenzhen trip and attend the meeting together.
This is my first time to fly! It was also my first time to participate in a large Shinan offline meeting. I was quite nervous before coming, and arranged for my roommate to help me format my computer if I didn&#39;t come back safely (even joked about writing a good suicide note before leavinghh), but it actually felt like a bus (because there would be bumps up and down, and the high speed train only swayed left and right). Two hours of flight, a little bit more than enough. The plane is also relatively quiet, because there is no network at high altitude, so there is no phone calls, video playback or anything. The scenery above the clouds is quite beautiful, always sunny, deep blue sky, endless sea of clouds, quiet and mysterious. It would be nice to have the ability to fly. I would love to travel between the clouds!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;! &lt;a href=&#34;https://c01dkit.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/assets/images/20230407inforsec/Snipaste_2023-04-10_20-04-58.jpg&#34;&gt;Fly to Shenzhen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;at-the-conference&#34;&gt;At the conference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two-day conference as a whole was still very meaningful, meeting very many young teachers, and the conference as a whole was not dull. There was a funny storyline, one of the teachers joked in the morning of the first day, &amp;quot;After listening to this report, I feel desperate for xxx&amp;quot;, and everyone laughed happily. After the teachers shared, the moderator would also tease &amp;quot;I am now desperate for this field&amp;quot;, which again triggered a burst of laughter. Even the next day, when the boss came to host the roundtable, he also appropriately invoked this stunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first day in the afternoon when you sign in you can also get a free book! The four tea breaks between the two days were also good, although not as good as last year&#39;s tea break in Hangzhou mid-year report, but also can be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;! &lt;a href=&#34;https://c01dkit.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/assets/images/20230407inforsec/Snipaste_2023-04-10_20-05-40.jpg&#34;&gt;venue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;shenzhen-tour&#34;&gt;Shenzhen Tour&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside the meeting, we also night tour of Shenzhen city village, in the food street ate authentic intestinal noodles and fried beef river (the first night, are not eaten hhh), I have to say, as long as 10 plus ingredients, will give very much beef. But the taste of the intestinal noodles to eat and Hangzhou feel similar. The last night with Yifan and Ling Ming ate beef hot pot, experiencing a queue of forty to fifty minutes, and after the meal and swimming in the night, while strolling and chatting, feeling Shenzhen Gao Xuan&#39;s Chonglou and the smell of barging lanes. The buildings built in different eras, different rhythms of life within a screen, is indeed a very novel experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;! &lt;a href=&#34;https://c01dkit.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/assets/images/20230407inforsec/Snipaste_2023-04-10_20-06-17.jpg&#34;&gt;Niuhe &amp;amp; Sausage Noodles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;! &lt;a href=&#34;https://c01dkit.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/assets/images/20230407inforsec/Snipaste_2023-04-10_20-03-59.jpg&#34;&gt;Garcinia cambogia flavored ice cream&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the most unbearable is the street construction is really not, pedestrians, non-motorized vehicles (and even motor vehicles) are in a lane (because many roads do not give non-motorized lanes, so the sidewalk is a non-motorized lane), retrograde, downstream, carrying people, honking, there are two-wheeled, three-wheeled, four-wheeled will be walking in front of people walking from behind or driving past, feeling very uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s just a pity that there are no sights to see, like what the Window of the World did not go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;! &lt;a href=&#34;https://c01dkit.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/assets/images/20230407inforsec/Snipaste_2023-04-10_20-06-50.jpg&#34;&gt;Snack Street&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;! &lt;a href=&#34;https://c01dkit.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/assets/images/20230407inforsec/Snipaste_2023-04-10_20-07-31.jpg&#34;&gt;Night view of the flyover&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nanke-tour&#34;&gt;Nanke Tour&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the two-day meeting gave meal tickets, but went to the central restaurant to see the eyes, feel to wait in line for a very long time, and thus did not use, right as a souvenir. Speaking of here, the more interesting thing is the first day out of the search for KFC, around the restaurant around a large circle, found that there are on-campus KFC, go in and found that it is still the same restaurant and just came out, really very interesting. The first day at SUSTech, I also went to the Memorial Hall to buy a short sleeve with the SUSTech logo on it (because I didn&#39;t feel like I could bring any short sleeve when I came out hh), and a pack of postcards!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;! &lt;a href=&#34;https://c01dkit.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/assets/images/20230407inforsec/Snipaste_2023-04-10_20-15-12.jpg&#34;&gt;SUSTech mark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-feelings&#34;&gt;Some feelings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus of the meeting is actually not to listen to the report, but to meet the big brother, social (offline communication, add friends), the first day and other people together to add Mr. Huang&#39;s WeChat, the second day took the initiative to add Mr. Zhou&#39;s WeChat (but have not asked questions), and so we have a few days after the business trip, back to Hangzhou, and then have the opportunity to ask for advice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of gain, it is actually a change in mindset and a fuller understanding. In the roundtable, the teachers talked about the traits they want in a PhD student, from primary to secondary, which are &lt;strong&gt;strong self-drive, curiosity about technology, and resilience&lt;/strong&gt;. If you have self-drive, you will communicate and solve problems in time, instead of passively waiting for the group meeting when you are asked to say that there is no progress; if you have curiosity about technology, you will keep searching for microscopic exploration and get self-improvement; if you have tenacity, you will not be deterred by failure and rejection again and again, and finally fix the right result. As for cleverness and diligence, that is the last thing I would consider &amp;quot;cleverness&amp;quot;. Reflecting on the fact that I started to do the project on my own, I have been rather passive and passive, searching for information without a clear goal orientation, trying methods without thinking deeply, and not even thinking clearly about the scenario, whether it is necessary to do, what the problems and challenges are. How can we make some progress if we deny ourselves from the very beginning?
What should we do in the future? It is better to have a proper attitude towards research and not to do research for the sake of research. In addition, you should know some common sense, such as journals, conferences, related teams, latest progress and so on, and not to work behind closed doors.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;After graduating from sixth grade, my father bought a white MP5 &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.c01dkit.com/en/life/about-reading-novels/#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for me, which could be connected to the computer with a data cable to download movies and novels. Since then, I began to contact the net novels, and a lot of things happened. At that time, I like to search for various txt resources, and then is addicted to it, reading day and night. I didn&#39;t know the difference between &amp;quot;serialized&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;finished&amp;quot;, and often found that many books were written halfway through and then abruptly ran out of text, and always thought it was because I didn&#39;t buy VIP chapters and saved the free chapters. Later, after reading more, I realized that these books were actually still being updated, or simply &amp;quot;eunuch&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.c01dkit.com/en/life/about-reading-novels/#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;quot;. So after reading the novel only to find the finished look, a read to read all in one breath, otherwise the chest is difficult to be even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite genre of online literature is online game novels. Some online game novels are just a slight adaptation of the real world game, write a new story, the whole or reality. And most are those holographic online novels, which are generally set in the distant future, where technology is so advanced (or alien technology) that there exists a device that allows everyone to consciously access a virtual game in their sleep (such as the most basic game helmets, expensive, nutritional pods/game pods that provide nutritional fluids to maintain physical physiology, or game rings), and the logic of this game is controlled by a super advanced intelligent body (generally known as light brain, wisdom brain and so on) control, will evolve on its own, human can not interfere. The general logic of such novels is that the protagonist enters the game and gets a golden finger due to a series of hidden plots, then forms a team, reigns supreme, and finally gets a beautiful woman. Of course, there are also some novels where the main character discovers that the game is a conspiracy or a crisis, and finally saves the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it is a virtual game, it inevitably touches on reality, i.e. what to do after &amp;quot;going offline&amp;quot;? Most online game novels avoid talking about it, such as the protagonist is an orphan; some games directly turn the protagonist into an NPC, such as &amp;quot;Online game of the rookie is crazy&amp;quot; (this one was written 11 years ago and has not been updated after October 2022, so I don&#39;t know if the author is out of something), &amp;quot;Super God mechanic&amp;quot;. Even when they write about real life, they tend to pass by. Admittedly, readers are also very aware of the faggotry of life, so they tend to enjoy reading the game parts as well. In between, there are new ways of writing, such as the interweaving of game and real abilities (gradually becoming urban alien novels) and so on, such as &amp;quot;The Ring is Crazy&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;I Have a House of Adventure&amp;quot; (this one is also different from the traditional online game novels).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why I like this kind of novel is that the main character can die and then come back to life, so it is not like a mystery or urban novel, where the main character can always turn out to be lucky, and reading it always lacks a sense of tension of life and death hanging by a hair. On the other hand, this kind of novel, in addition to the basic setting, leaves a lot of room for the author to play, so there is always a lot of fun to read. For example, in the &amp;quot;online game of reverse&amp;quot; written by Zhang Yang&#39;s May, the protagonist researched his own game helmet to access the game and found that debuffs became buffs and buffs became debuffs, so he embarked on a very interesting adventure. Speaking of &amp;quot;interesting&amp;quot;, butterfly blue pen &amp;quot;online game of melee mage&amp;quot; to read is also hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the online game novels became less read. It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t like them anymore, but I feel that the classics have all been read, and most online novels are either too cheesy or full of violence and shibboleth, which is unbearable to watch. So I turned to fantasy novels, such as &amp;quot;immortal&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;sword&amp;quot; (only read the first 14 books), this kind of novel its writing is concise, elegant style, give people a beautiful enjoyment. My favorite episode was the &amp;quot;transformation into a mortal&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;Immortal Reversal&amp;quot;, which was very exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that summer, due to reading novels day and night, resulting in a significant decline in vision. In addition, the pressure of middle and high school classes, the immediate need for computers in college, vision is worsening. However, I still don&#39;t wear glasses on daily (only when I look at the blackboard from a distance), which may be the last stubborn. Now that I think about it, that MP5 is the beginning of my road to reading online articles, the key to open new doors. Later, I also tried to write some novels, such as &amp;quot;online game of scroll master&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;online game of soul mage&amp;quot;, but read to feel the narrative dry, no spirit between the lines, lack of good, and then gave up. But the fantasy of the other world, the tranquility of transcending the bitter reality and seeking spiritual solace, is the vision that many people who are overwhelmed by life can breathe, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A digital device with low power consumption, technical difficulty and cost by using soft and hard cooperative multimedia processing technology. Its main frequency can reach up to 1GHz and can play more video formats such as avi, asf, dat, rm, rmvb, etc. It is gradually being phased out due to the development of internet and smart phones.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.c01dkit.com/en/life/about-reading-novels/#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, the &amp;quot;break&amp;quot;, the net author to write half of the writing can not continue, either no longer update the following, or casually scribble directly to the end of the big.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.c01dkit.com/en/life/about-reading-novels/#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally I caught up with the end of August and wrote this article in the Life Series. When I think about it, it seems that this month has passed too quickly and there are no wonderful moments worth sharing. When I look at August, it stretches like an eternity; but once I look away, this eternity of countless moments also falls apart and disappears. What disappears together is the awareness of the unconscious. Those sounds and colors, light and heat, sometimes high and sometimes low self-awareness, sometimes full and sometimes lacking passion for life, all slowly fermenting in the humid heat of Hangzhou, rising in the cicadas and converging over the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I refuse to give myself a few days of summer vacation, my mind is already connected to countless people from far away. Even if you are moving around in a small space, you can take advantage of the internet stream to travel to the sky, and interact with countless virtual human beings, forgetting all about them, not knowing which year it is. The cheaper the cost of communication, the more shallow the benefits of communication; the more you meet with countless virtual human beings, the more moments are consumed, corrupted, and finally eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is still some art in talking to people. Recognize what level the other person is, what level you are, and whether you are on an equal footing in the conversation. It is not necessary to change two new faces to &amp;quot;differentiate&amp;quot; because of the status of the superiority, but the ease and self-congratulation of the conversation should really grasp the proportion. Understand what their needs are, what the other party&#39;s needs are, and whether they can do some effective communication, after all, everyone&#39;s time is limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strings and the words are elusive. A point into the small-minded impatience, a point back is the isolation of self-regard. The heart will be able to smile, do not understand the really depressed, half-understanding the misunderstanding of the two sides, reached &amp;quot;their&amp;quot; &amp;quot;consensus&amp;quot;, for after the mine, it is not good for both sides. That is why it is necessary to &amp;quot;double-check and repeat&amp;quot;, and it would be better if you could give one or two examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope should also be restrained. To throw yourself away and put all your future into others is not responsible for yourself. The subtlety of &amp;quot;self-consciousness&amp;quot; itself is inscrutable and not worth mentioning in the grand cosmic perspective. When one occasionally gets a glimpse of reincarnation while traveling in heaven and earth, it is enough to make one&#39;s heart and soul horrified and lost in the vastness, unable to stop for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The edge with people, but a period of time of eagerness, and then can not be permanent. The plain as water edge, even if it is not contacted after several years, can be as familiar as the first casual chat one or two, is enough. In the world but a hundred years, the end of the silence is the final place to return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you have noticed that we are being densely wrapped in nostalgia. Cultural materials belonging to the last decade, two decades or even three decades are once again on the table, being re-measured and digested by us. Wang Xinling&#39;s song &amp;quot;Love You&amp;quot;, released in 2004, became a hit again this spring, triggering the archaeological trend of Taiwanese idol dramas; the variety show &amp;quot;The Sound of Life&amp;quot; has aroused nostalgia for the golden years of Hong Kong&#39;s music industry; the 11-year-old TV series &amp;quot;Legend of Donnie Yen&amp;quot; was &amp;quot;plated out&amp;quot;; when Liu Yifei appeared in the new film &amp;quot;The Dreaming&amp;quot;, the 17-year-old character &amp;quot;Zhao Ling&#39;er&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Legend of the Immortal Sword and Wonderful 1 The role of &amp;quot;Zhao Ling&#39;er&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Legend of the Immortal Sword and Wonderful 1&amp;quot; from 17 years ago were quickly picked out and revisited. Between the new and the old, we prefer the familiar, safe and certain narrative. Why are we getting nostalgic? What does it mean when most people look more to the past than to the &amp;quot;present&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;future&amp;quot;? How do we restore confidence in the future? We had a two-hour conversation with counselor Cui Qinglong on this topic. Cui Qinglong is a counselor with rich professional theory and practice experience, and he writes on Weibo, which includes not only the understanding of individual psychology, but also the insight of the social psychology of this era. We start with the psychological mechanism of nostalgia. According to Cui Qinglong, the nostalgia of the times is not unique to the land we live in. When the curve of social development slows down, when people pass the point with the greatest slope, they can&#39;t help looking back to the past when there was a time of hope and possibility. In his opinion, nostalgia is not a bad thing, it is like a warm and comfortable safe nest, we can always choose to stay in it for a short while. But more importantly, when we retreat from the safe nest, how can we apply the experience of the past to the present, forge a fork in the path that has been established in the past decades, and gain the courage to explore. Will tomorrow be better? Cui Qinglong says there is no answer to this question for now, but we can still delineate our own &amp;quot;isolation zone&amp;quot; and build order within it - &amp;quot;Even if the downward macro curve is no longer within one&#39;s control, one can create an upward curve in one&#39;s own little world. Whether it&#39;s physical, skill growth, or social, the problem we face now is how we find personal self-care at the micro level, and this is very important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below, &amp;quot;People&amp;quot; talks with Cui Qinglong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People: Some time ago, the public frequently discussed Wang Xinling&#39;s &amp;quot;Love You&amp;quot; and Taiwanese early idol dramas, and recently, because of Liu Yifei, they started to revisit &amp;quot;Legend of the Immortal Sword&amp;quot;, including the topic of old actors reuniting in some variety shows, which also often aroused attention. According to your observation, has there been a trend of nostalgia in the last two years? Why are there more and more nostalgic voices?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cui Qinglong: Earlier on, I would occasionally see short videos on some streaming platforms with clips of old movies, and these videos often had high click-through rates, and I would occasionally click on them myself, even if I was already familiar with the content. These videos have a common feature, they are generally about 20 years ago movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nostalgia has become a trend in the past two years, and I think there are two reasons for this. On the one hand, people are less and less interested in TV shows nowadays, and over-marketing can make program companies gather all the successful elements to create content, which is actually an algorithmic success, and it&#39;s less the kind of thing that makes people instantly recognize its own uniqueness. Another internal factor is that people want to respond with nostalgia to some psychological experience they are missing in today&#39;s times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remembered a man who used to tell me that he knew a lot of friends from different cities so that every time he went to that city, he knew who to invite and didn&#39;t have to re-establish relationships. I said, &amp;quot;Why don&#39;t you go and make some new ones? He said the cost is too high and you can&#39;t always make a friend who is a good fit in that short period of time. He had already screened these friends and everything was certain, so the relationship experience may not be the highest, but it&#39;s not the worst either, which saves him the cost of pre-exploration and understanding and uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analogy to the matter of nostalgia. If we watch a new film and are unfamiliar with it, we need to reboot ourselves to focus and concentrate as much as possible, which actually has a psychological drain in it. When we repeatedly watch an old movie, we already know its general plot, it may be less fresh, but it is also a film above the level we have already screened. Because we are familiar with the plot, even if we are distracted by other things, even if we are distracted for a while, we can still connect to that track, and this kind of viewing process is less mentally exhausting, and it is more thoroughly restful and relaxing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People: What kind of factors in your personal life or social environment evoke nostalgia?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cui Qinglong: The word &amp;quot;nostalgia&amp;quot; contains the meaning of nostalgia. If a person has experienced trauma in the past and has some bad memories, he or she will not use &amp;quot;nostalgia&amp;quot; to point to that memory. Nostalgia contains a relatively carefree and happy life experience in a certain period of time. In that state of mind, you overlap with better memories of the past and feel happy or satisfied. When many people lack such experiences in real life and have a sense that they will not be able to create them in the future, they are likely to go back to the past frequently to find such experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once had a visitor who was working abroad alone, and he said he had watched &amp;quot;The Cook&#39;s Tale&amp;quot; almost 40 times and had memorized the plot. When he was at home, he would turn on the TV and play it in the background, and then do something else by himself. He said he would feel as if there was really a group of familiar people talking at home, very lively, very joyful. So nostalgia has an emotional companionship function at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People: How do you understand the phenomenon of nostalgia from the perspective of psychology? Is it a good or bad sign?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cui Qinglong: Occasional nostalgia, pointing to the past, is not a problem, because old memories play an important role in our psychology, and we need to pull some experiences and emotions from the past to guide the present. But if a person goes back to the past so often that he can&#39;t even come out of it, then he is tantamount to losing the present, and that&#39;s when it is negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In counseling, we will not directly intervene in the matter of nostalgia itself, and we will not advise him to withdraw from the past at once, because then he may have no &amp;quot;place&amp;quot; to go, and he will feel even worse. Behind the behavior is always a reflection of deeper emotional issues, such as an unfamiliar environment, combined with the vulnerability and loneliness that one has grown up with, when nostalgia is like a warm harbor that one can return to at any time. As the consultation moved forward, his time and frequency of using this function slowly decreased, and he built something else in his life that no longer required over-enabling the function of nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People: There is a group on Douban called &amp;quot;Pretend to live in 1980-2000&amp;quot;, and there are more than 100,000 members in this group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cui Qinglong: Around the millennium was a watershed moment when people&#39;s overall feelings about life, the world, and the future changed dramatically. I remember when I was a kid, to ask someone out, it would take me 30 or 40 minutes to run to his house and call him, there was no other way to contact him. We stayed together and had no other distractions, but instead devoted all of our focused time to relational interactions. Everything has to be done in a highly focused way without too many distracting elements. At that time, the experience of relationships is very pristine and has a very dense emotional experience in it. You don&#39;t even feel that you are feeling anything in particular, it is muddy and you are right in the middle of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, it was a time of huge incremental space. The reform and opening up was happening, the changes in the whole society were visible, and there was a space for an infinite future. People from all walks of life generally had a sense of hope and decided that if I put my heart and soul into doing a good job and learning a skill, I could lead a decent life, and people generally had such a firm mental expectation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People: As we can see, there are dramas like &amp;quot;Please Answer 1988&amp;quot; in Korea, which recorded and nostalgically remembered the time when Korea hosted the Olympic Games and its economy started to take off. In fact, Europe, America, Japan and Korea all experienced similar &amp;quot;golden years&amp;quot;, but as the growth curve slowed down, the social mentality began to change, such as the &amp;quot;no-edge society&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;fewer children&amp;quot; in Japan. What kind of social psychology fluctuates in the course of repeated historical twists and turns?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be more precise, social psychology does not depend on the absolute value of the height of social development, but on the slope of its development. As long as this slope is maintained, most people will still have the enthusiasm to strive. Once this slope slows down, even if you reach a very high point, even if you are born in a developed country with a high monthly salary, people will become bored and depressed in their own social struggle trajectory due to the loss of sufficient incremental space. You work hard and you will find that it doesn&#39;t seem to improve anything, it doesn&#39;t make you feel that you have the ability to reach another completely different world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our previous generation was born with a particularly low starting point and no resources, but they went through the process of going from very low to leaps and bounds, and the psychological well-being of people is not based on absolute values, but on a continuous incremental process. The younger generation is different. At first people are in a relatively safe position, with no worries about food and clothing, and generally educated, and then gradually move downward into the invisible and long-standing pressure and burnout, which is the painful difference between generations, and is an analogy between the low absolute value of the previous generation (hard years) and the lack of space for development of young people (no sense of future), and this is where the two generations have difficulty empathizing with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the incremental space shrinks, the involution also arises, which is what we often call the stock competition. This is when people are passively involved in a more brutal game environment. Japan and South Korea are two countries that have demonstrated this process first. The fertility rate in South Korea is now the lowest in the world, and many people prefer to choose a lower-quality version of life, which is actually replacing psychological space with real space, or what we call &amp;quot;lying flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People: What does it mean for a society when people start to collectively feel nostalgic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cui Qinglong: If we divide a person&#39;s experience into past, present and future, when a group of people go to only one place in a high frequency and persistently, it means that the other two places do not give them a good experience. When nostalgia becomes a collective phenomenon, people are generally fleeing from the present and the future, not wanting to lean on these two places, either because the process of leaning is painful, or because there is no place to lean on. So I think it is not a good sign, it contains some hidden pain in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sense of future in this era is very thin for many people, because it is an era that has developed to a high degree of order and lacks the necessary randomness, which makes many people clearly anticipate what their future life will be like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People: Is the wave of collective nostalgia an ineffective sweetener?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cui Qinglong: I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an ineffective sweetener, it can soothe a person&#39;s emotions and has a positive meaning. It is a way to take care of oneself in a moment of relative helplessness and loss in the face of the general environment, and it should be understood. What we really need to worry about is whether this sweetener will slowly turn into a person&#39;s spiritual main course, as it maps the present and future reality that may no longer be important to many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People: You mentioned earlier that &amp;quot;we should not only live in the present, but also be able to connect our past and future.&amp;quot; How do you understand this statement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cui Qinglong: One of the assessments of mental health mentions &amp;quot;awareness,&amp;quot; which focuses on whether a person is able to integrate experiences from different dimensions of time. When we have problems with awareness, the ratio of past, present, and future can become severely dysfunctional, and a person can shape his or her life according to this dysfunctionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a person who has just experienced a breakup and bereavement will be completely caught up in the past, unable to focus on the present and the future. And a person who lives entirely in the fantasy of the future will be unable to effectively look back on the past or initiate action in the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A proper proportion of the present should be the largest, at least around five to six percent. The past is remembered to allow us to learn and grow, and the future guides us in which direction to go in the present; the three are like an olive-shaped structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the most important thing is to confirm the proportion of the &amp;quot;now&amp;quot; part, to confirm whether we can create a state of life for ourselves in the present that we are happy to commit to, which, to put it bluntly, means that you are having fun and are content to live in the present. The &amp;quot;now&amp;quot; is your home, and you can go live somewhere for a while, but eventually you have to come back here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People: How does the loss of influence on the grand future affect our micro lives specifically? On a larger scale, when groups lose their expectations of the future, how does that affect society?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cui Qinglong: Once you don&#39;t pay attention to the future, people will tend to enter the mentality of &amp;quot;pendulum&amp;quot; in life, and if you can&#39;t pursue the big goals, I&#39;ll just settle for the rest and get by. People in this mentality, the ability to work and creativity will be significantly reduced, but also the overall efficiency of the operation of society will be passively reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social pressure is passed throughout the social system and eventually gets passed on to everyone, causing tension at the interpersonal level. Now that everyone online is so unfriendly, so sensitive and fragile, and easily provoked to, these aggressions are in a sense not just their own, but the restlessness of the whole society, which superimposes the emotional tension of the whole society, resulting in a general alienation and mistrust between people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With such future expectations, people also become more pessimistic about intimate relationships. At this time, people first face relationships with a stop-loss mentality, all minding the real and psychological costs that cannot be compensated, unwilling to pay first, all hoping to be in a safe position. When everyone is in their safe position, the psychological distance between each other is already too big to get close and cohesive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People: When the certain and repetitive path of the past does not work, how should we rebuild our own path and fight against uncertainty? Are there some feasible ways?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qinglong Cui: In the sphere of personal influence and control, we can do things that can bring enough expectation and feedback. This is tantamount to creating an action and experience level baseline for one&#39;s life, which allows one to order and automate one&#39;s life, and one&#39;s psyche will become ordered accordingly. The ordered part is particularly important, to put it in a fashionable way, it is the part that is resisting the entropy increase in one&#39;s life and spiritual world. Once these ordered parts are able to function automatically, it means that it no longer consumes mental effectiveness, or it consumes very little. Just like someone who exercises, writes, and socializes every day, I write a tweet every day without the mindset of a task to complete it; it is in a constant, steady state, including my work, my entertainment. With the premise of having a basic plate, then exploring other possibilities, it&#39;s like installing more interesting plug-ins to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would try some different sports, get in touch with some different things, like archery or shooting or whatever. One of my visitors said that if there was something new in his life, he made sure to experience it. His life is rich because he slowly finds parts of his life that match him and sink into him from within these unknown options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People: You mentioned a point in your microblog that the epidemic and involution have created caches and fragments for our psyche that are difficult to clean up, how should we proactively deal with these leftover psychological debts and complete a full, immersive exploration?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qinglong Cui: When one is in a state of inadequate psychological efficacy, one subconsciously avoids and does not face things. For example, if I have a bad relationship with someone, I won&#39;t communicate about this relationship in the first place. For example, if I have to have a regular medical checkup, I won&#39;t do it first, and if I don&#39;t finish a work task, I won&#39;t deal with it first. The home is very messy, I also first do not go to clean up. Many similar things more, like a background program has been right there to stay, it has occupied your mental space. If you are in a state of great powerlessness and self-doubt for a long time, it means that there is something dragging you in the background. This is the time to wonder what is running in the background on its own, it could be an emotion you are ignoring or a thing you are procrastinating on. Once there is enough mental effectiveness, it is best to go ahead and get rid of it. That thing is mental debt, and it&#39;s important that we go through it, or at least give it a plan and clean it up regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People: For someone who has lost the courage to try, how do you get him on the path of discovery?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cui Qinglong: First of all, it depends on the extent to which he has lost his courage. Some people will recover naturally after a period of time after a setback. And some people, like a snail, will encounter frustration, directly curled up inside a small shell, as far as possible to avoid contact with reality, the outside world is imagined to be much more terrible than the actual. At this time, he needs to re-examine reality and needs to reach out for something new outside of his psychologically safe boundaries to make his psychological safety zone bigger. Imagine a small child just learning to walk, he takes a few steps to look back at the adults behind him, fearing that he has lost or the adults have disappeared. Slowly, he will walk further and further away and will feel a new sense of security. This is actually how people grow up and shrink back after encountering setbacks, and when we lose our courage, we need to rebuild it in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploration is essentially expanding our sense of security. Before exploring, we make sure that the uncertainty and danger of things is something we can afford to do. Don&#39;t go out on a limb and head straight for total uncertainty. Exploration is a process of slowly expanding to the periphery, centered on the original safe territory. If something is particularly unsafe for you, such a thing may not be suitable for you to explore at this stage. But relatively, there must be a relatively safe thing, just a little less solid, this kind of thing is optional. The places you have explored will slowly become safe territory that you are familiar with. It&#39;s a slow, but very worthwhile process to try to go from being relatively less safe to becoming safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People: Do we also need to embrace the self that is always nostalgic and craves security?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cui Qinglong: I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a problem for someone to repeatedly look at familiar, old things. In a sense, at that moment, he subconsciously feels that it is a comfortable choice. There used to be a group of gamers who would buy a lot of new games, but not even play them once, or not for long before they turned them off, they called themselves electronically impotent, so they only played old games they had already played, or retro games from a decade or two ago, this kind of nostalgic behavior can be seen everywhere today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as people are not too optimistic about the general environment, this nostalgia wave will always continue, it is the behavior refracted by people&#39;s psychological need for familiarity, security, warmth, affection and ease, and we should learn to accept this behavior unconditionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accepting yourself unconditionally is a particularly important thing, not because of what you do and what kind of person you are, but because no matter what you do or who you are, you should go ahead and accept yourself, unconditionally. This level of acceptance can only be given to yourself and is most deserving. Unconditional self-acceptance does not mean indulgence in oneself, but a deep empathy and understanding of oneself. When a person truly accepts himself unconditionally, he will instead turn away from indulgence. So, let nostalgia be nostalgia, let yourself stay inside your safe nest for a while, and don&#39;t be hard on yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People: When we have doubts about the proposition of &amp;quot;tomorrow will be better&amp;quot;, how can we restore our confidence in the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cui Qinglong: I don&#39;t really want to say things like &amp;quot;after this year is over, next year will be better&amp;quot;. From the perspective of the law of economic development, the general environment will not turn in a short time, and the inflection point of the downside has not yet arrived. The most important thing now is not to expect its inflection point to come quickly, but how we learn to accept it with a new mentality in such a downward cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to accept the fact that the world has entered a low-speed state and we don&#39;t have the means to maintain a higher speed or expectation and get a lot of strong feedback as before. At this level it is temporarily insurmountable. When society is in a downward cycle, it is unlikely that people&#39;s psychology will be generally upward and high; social psychology will not show a deviation from the social context, and I am talking about the incremental part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even if the downward macro curve is no longer within one&#39;s control, one can still create an upward curve in one&#39;s own little world, create one&#39;s own personal slope of growth, from the little things that can be influenced by oneself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote that sometimes one can lose control of one&#39;s micro life because one loses influence over the big future, such as eating, sleeping, learning, skill building, entertainment, health, positive thinking, emotional regulation, travel, socializing, etc. All these things can create control points. When we can practice these &amp;quot;little things&amp;quot; as initiators of action, we can gradually regain a sense of control over our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is like creating a strong enough boat for ourselves, and in such a boat, we can say that the future will be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;gas-station&#34;&gt;Gas Station&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw them standing on the roof of a car gas station shed, dreaming like no one had ever dreamed before. They jumped, waved their hands, shouted in silence, and then the shed rose from the ground and slowly rose. I saw two or three policemen holding the supporting pillars and flying up with the shed. Little by little, they climbed upward, and the shed suddenly flew flat and away, and soon disappeared from sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it did not take long for the police to return with the shed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Today&#39;s college entrance examination, no one can run!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;returning-rural-home&#34;&gt;Returning Rural Home&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path up the mountain was rugged. Walking high and low on the sandy, fleshy yellow earth vacated between unknown greenery. Finally we arrived at the grocery store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Have you made the covid test?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Not yet!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The middle-aged old man stared at my father and me, as if confirming something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Come on in, the seeds and fertilizer are over there.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-dragon&#34;&gt;The Dragon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was supposed to be a simple sparring match, but I didn&#39;t expect them to miss. Blood flowed down from the brother&#39;s chest, and his body fell backwards, falling off the bridge into the river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sister was anxious, and without any words, she drew her sword and cut off the three men, and fell asleep at the stone table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she woke up, the three men were sitting around her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We dragons are immortal!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of them laughed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;intelligent-robot-library&#34;&gt;Intelligent Robot Library&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking through the library, outside the floor-to-ceiling windows is the desert yellow sand. Several large-sized machine spiders slowly move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The library shelves are protected by glass, and each book is a one-time experience to absorb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked for where the power was in the flickering light - cut the power and turn off the protection!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the second floor came the voice of a friendly man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I thought there was very clean glass here, but I didn&#39;t think there was really any.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;waterpark&#34;&gt;Waterpark&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Didn&#39;t you guys feel it?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The water in this swimway is so hot, like taking a bath.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Let&#39;s go in the bath together!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of about ten of us went into the unopened sauna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They gathered together, and I was alone with rrc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spiraling down from a height of about ten meters might be considered a game, but I didn&#39;t see an exit below before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it a grindstone? Or was it a dark pool?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hongmen-banquet&#34;&gt;Hongmen Banquet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chef invited all meat-eaters to the feast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warmly received one by one, and most of the meat-eaters arrived together, unwilling to wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&#39;t want to wait, just go straight to the door and walk across that long red carpet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;♪ (Stop them --) ♪&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s too late, about to appear in the flashing lights and make a scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without seeing blood, without making a sound, the limbs fall off and go in the trash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The face is saved, the big fight breaks out; what&#39;s the point of all the previous efforts when you tear your face off?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blood-red-goose&#34;&gt;Blood Red Goose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vast earthen pit lake with countless critters rising and falling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am the blood-red, blood-red goose, called to this place to fight with the king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming the only one in this place, I walked under the willow trees on the lake and talked with the elders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There is still a long time to grow ......&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new blood-red goose descends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It seems that an unknown challenger has come, never before, what about the fight for the one and only ......&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wake-up&#34;&gt;Wake Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entrance to the school was exactly the earthen pit lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My classmates accepted their assignments and headed out into the dimly lit lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some took the excavator to dig; some dug with shovels; some went in the excavator and broke down in the middle, so they walked back with one step deep and one shallow footprint end&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Stop - don&#39;t do that!&amp;quot; I said to their steward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They only care about your labor, bringing more surplus value to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- it&#39;s pointless, don&#39;t keep obeying!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They cast a confused look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Only we, ourselves, can decide what we shall to do! We ought to work for ourselves!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jailed&#34;&gt;Jailed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small cramped room, the size of a few toilet pits, the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;white partitions, a medium-sized white tile floor that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next to the alcove where I don&#39;t know what will flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The door was closed, if anyone had walked by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ankles were already chained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And two or three people were imprisoned in this small place like a toilet like a bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unarmed, pondering, how to escape?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;commodity&#34;&gt;Commodity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an era of advanced technology, there are always people who are uprooted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this fate is born unjust, because this wealth always gather above&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She joined the game of small worlds, lost her place, lost the ability to return to the reality&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her efforts and struggles have become a currency of less than one unit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To provide for her former father&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her fate, born as a commodity, has been set the bargaining chips&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;exposure&#34;&gt;Exposure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was born that way, a sharp thorn in the flesh and blood hideous&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t want to expose myself to others because only a few can agree&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In high houses, at the bottom of wells, in the noisy streets, at the railings under the winter sun&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone wears different masks, disguising and hiding their own kinds of things&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am tired of hiding under the mask all day long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let go of it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized that the FC people around me are the same as me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the sacrifice is the loss of all other friends and family from the past&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;quarantine&#34;&gt;Quarantine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A relaxing quarantine like a tourist vacation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the small residential-like washroom, there is a large bathtub on one side and a sink on the other&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smoothly polished marble floor like a mirror, warm soft light&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Come here, the door is open for ya.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turn around and walk out of the small room, only to be suddenly transformed into a dilapidated hall&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wooden floor in disrepair was unevenly stained with black stains and chipped corners&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weeds were even growing in the urinal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the dormitory building, three or two people came in gradually towards the consciousness can not focus on the place now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In spite of this, let him come here.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;flooded-by-water&#34;&gt;Flooded by Water&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world was flooded and people were diving in the deep blue water&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swimming freely and rapidly under the surface of the water&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the tentacles of a jellyfish, like the clouds of an airplane&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands pulling out satin of varying sizes of blue and red&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The water descends and becomes muddy near the ground, full of sludge and scum&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was as if a new land had opened up, as if it had arrived in the lower city&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a lifetime ago, the building turned into a wet-stained muddy alley&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We are going to start a new life here.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we go back to the upper city to find resources, in a world that lacks clean water?&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&#39;ve suddenly become very upset without any warning. I was busy with my graduation thesis some time ago, and it took me a long time to turn it in, so I should start doing the defense PPT; the branch affairs came one after another, and I had to work for all parties day after day, and I was busy. On the contrary, I gradually began to lose patience with my own work, and simply passed by as if I was doing a show, and did not do anything meaningful or breakthrough progress. It seems that as long as there is a little hope to do something, it will soon be overwhelmed by the fatigue that comes from nowhere. I seek two reliefs, one is to quickly finish revising my dissertation and do the PPT to end this misery, and the other is to quickly finish the last branch meeting to get rid of this tedious change. The middle of June will be a big turning point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year is still the new crown epidemic, is not good. The dream of a graduation trip has also been shattered, and that was the last leisurely moment from the suffocating life of social animals, as described in countless movies and novels before 2019. After all, there are only two weeks of spring break in a year, so I should cherish the time and read more papers. The truth is to send more papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the recent month, I have become obsessed with drinking tea, brewing it once a day, drinking it from morning to night. Gradually feel their emotions gradually began to numb down, as if there will not be any dramatic fluctuations. Whether it is the looming ddl or with the group of friends, housemates, friends of the exchange, it seems to always be a well not wave, and even the actual exchange of something, but also a sentence to pass the time to say. So, it feels like the passion is gradually leaving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it my youth that is leaving me? That&#39;s interesting. Since I was a child, I&#39;ve been thinking that no matter what happens in the future, I should keep my original heart and always be full of innocence and childishness. But now, although I can still talk like a child, there is always a sense of detachment, as if what I say is just muscle memory formed by past experience, and what I actually think about. I don&#39;t know myself anymore. When I talk to real children, I always feel a sense of disconnection that is difficult to integrate, which is indeed a deep sadness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a plan has been made, how can I strictly follow it? Why do you have to put off until the last minute to finish something that was set a long time ago? Are you expecting something new to happen? Why do you always put your hope in others? I think it&#39;s the feeling of exhaustion that comes with doing something that you can&#39;t do. But it will be much better when you really get into it. What progress has been made as the days go by? I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s still very limited.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Today&#39;s first attempt to brew some tea bags, is before the roommate from outside to bring back the tea color. When working with headphones playing a little BGM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the task is more clearly arranged, purely to write code? Or is the tea has a refreshing effect? Or BGM to relax the spirit? Or maybe it&#39;s a change in the direction of the desktop computer screen stand, so that the phone away from their own? It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve been so focused on writing code that I didn&#39;t realize I was supposed to go to dinner until 16:50 (it had been 16:30 before).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I think about the previous thinking about writing a pwn problem, and now I am sleepy and inefficient when I work, what is the essential difference? It may be that pwn is a kind of work where the result is known and the method is certain; while scientific research is more like a dark road of groping, not knowing whether the task you do has meaning, effect, or innovation. The lack of certainty about the goal, and in the unknown in the stagnant or even reverse, is indeed a very painful thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early spring, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, there are many people in the circle of friends and space to share their photos and the fun of traveling together. I could smell the fresh smell of grass and trees on the way to the cafeteria, which made me glow again. Compared to the winter when the smell is cut off, it is a rare blessing to me that the smell and odor come from time to time in the spring and summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, in addition to work, I also go to read some tweets. It is said that modern people have been deprived of a lot of time by cell phones, and it seems that the fragmented time after work can only be used in this way to passively receive some messages. I also try to get away from my phone and put my attention to the work at hand, paper books and the world around me. Checking my phone from time to time has become a compulsion, but seeing no little red dots on WeChat is a lot easier, at least this time is at my own disposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite a long time ago, I noticed that my ability to express myself verbally and in writing was declining rapidly, probably because there were no school courses to attend, and I was exposed to less and less information about language and literature, and was overwhelmed by the turbulent flow of professional-specific, field-related, and miscellaneous fragmented messages. Instead of actively thinking about something, one passively receives information without even judging it; and not having some friends who can share anything and everything with impunity, anytime and anywhere, is really a crippling experience on a spiritual level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although living in heavy shackles, I feel more and more free these days. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a change of heart or a sign of &amp;quot;maturity&amp;quot;. Some things can be said casually, no longer have to be hidden like before. Maybe this is the fun of having something to say. The modern society is really getting stranger and stranger.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;It is time for me to talk about my undergraduate life, which has passed so quickly. Although I have been involved in many activities and work, I feel that I am not qualified to &amp;quot;advise on college planning&amp;quot;. It is better to talk about the memory of the past, and talk about the ideal of better behavior. Looking back on these four years of groping, there are always a thousand words, all kinds of thoughts haunting, difficult to express. After thinking about it for a long time, in a nutshell, I think it should be &amp;quot;know yourself, act freely&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my humble opinion, there are three realms of professional learning: first, a proper attitude, quality and quantity of coursework, which is the most basic requirement; second, the application of learning, knowledge internalization and migration to practical applications, which is a slightly higher level; third, diligent questioning, explore the direction of development of the field, which is the highest level, but also reached the foundation of scientific research. Nowadays, the popular &amp;quot;king of the volume&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;the lousy&amp;quot; are more like all kinds of jokes in the first realm, which are just shallow efforts and slacking off before reaching the shallow level. I still hope to explore more, accumulate more, and think more while I am young.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding club activities, it&#39;s just doing something with a group of people who have similar hobbies. Out of my love for ping pong and my major studies, I worked as an officer in the publicity department and the research and development department of the Ping Pong Association in my freshman year, and stayed as the head of these two departments in my sophomore year. I didn&#39;t have a lot of work to do because I was not a top-tier organization like the Tide. It was a good thing to balance study and after-school activities, to meet some friends, and to do some club work when there was not much pressure from the junior class. Changing campuses and coming to Yuquan was a big turning point. I stepped down from the two clubs, and with the idea of &amp;quot;doing something for the college&amp;quot;, I switched to doing some student work for the college. The environment in Yuquan is also more peaceful than that in Zijingang, without the &amp;quot;impetuous&amp;quot; atmosphere before, which is more suitable for &amp;quot;inward&amp;quot; thinking about oneself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About going on to graduate school, it was actually a bit surprising. I&#39;ve always had a low opinion of myself, especially in my sophomore year when I came up one place short of the pacesetter selection, and I was not ranked in the top five of my major for three years, which once made me so anxious that I bought a full set of study materials for my exams, intending to finally go to graduate school. The actual fact is that the way to calculate the performance point of the study is different from the way to calculate the scholarship, and then the interview score is not too low, so the review materials bought did not come in handy. So I hope that students who are still anxious don&#39;t get nervous and just do their own thing seriously. I joined the lab work from last summer, and it is really much busier than the first three years, so I hope that students who wish to go on to higher education will prepare in advance and contact their preferred teachers to join the lab work as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding daily life, it is very important to find the right way to regulate your emotions. There are often people on Doduo who show off their performance points, public numbers often push some &amp;quot;it&#39;s too late if you don&#39;t xxx&amp;quot; articles, and parents occasionally compare their children to others ...... which often invariably add to the anxiety. In addition to their own sometimes also in touch with the fish, associated with &amp;quot;better than you people than you also hard work&amp;quot;, and out of nowhere on some more guilt. If you find yourself in these negative emotions, you may want to meet a few friends on weekends to hike, hike; do some interesting projects; stay away from social media, read more paper books, write articles, free from peer pressure, it will be much better. In addition, instead of comparing yourself to some &amp;quot;virtual&amp;quot; &amp;quot;role models&amp;quot;, you should try to build quality social relationships with the right people around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back on the teachers I have met over the past four years, I am most impressed by Ms. Liang. She once said, &amp;quot;The difference between an extrovert and an introvert is not whether he is talkative or not, but where he gets the &#39;energy&#39; to continue his work. If a person is still glowing after attending a party with many people, he is extroverted; while if he feels exhausted, he is more inclined to be introverted.&amp;quot; As a student at the School of Accountancy, one may have the stereotypical self-perception of a &amp;quot;silent &#39;autistic child&#39;&amp;quot; from time to time, but according to Mr. Liang&#39;s thinking, it is also possible to be just a &amp;quot;non-verbal &#39;socially awkward&#39;&amp;quot;. Therefore, there is no need to be discouraged about your social skills because you are not very sociable. For me, it is more important to use this time to try to walk some untraveled paths, to have a clear understanding of myself, and to discover my strengths and weaknesses. Acknowledging my own flaws is the only way to improve and avoid some anxiety and confusion that comes from nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A thousand words are just one family&#39;s words, each person&#39;s path has a different landscape. Use these few years to identify yourself and do something meaningful, that is, to live up to your youth, to live up to your youth.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;The smoke from the cigarettes dissipated, and the scent of tea leaves, which had been brewed several times, mixed in the slightly humid air - in the hallway with only the tile floor illuminated by cold light and the walls painted once a year. Smelling the faint fragrance of green tea sugar, I felt like I was back ten or so years ago, running around in the living room of my grandfather&#39;s house; and like I was going to that winter afternoon ten years later, when the sun shone orange and yellow, warm and warm, soft and gentle through the window, shining on the computer desk, illuminating half of the computer screen, and half of the photos. This is the breath of the fourth floor of the School of Materials this afternoon. And after walking this distance to the School of Computer Science, it was another new smell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A keen sense of smell brings me many images. Although what I smelled may not be the actual scent, after a kind of imagination-like reproduction, it has been portrayed as a memory, or an imagination ...... is able to practically change my whole mood. From the various smells that were mixed together, one peculiar flavor after another was finely divided, and time slowed down all of a sudden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scent of the first floor of the dormitory sometimes takes me back to my kindergarten days. The mattress was stained with dried milk and soaked with urine, half of which was covered under the long-lost quilt and pressed under the sleeping boy; half of which had just been exposed to the summer sun and was retrieved from the drying rack by the teacher, with a little cool breeze from outside the door and the smell of iron from the gray and white steel pipes. During the lunch break, there were many wooden beds with green paint in the hall, and many children were sleeping. I was the child who couldn&#39;t sleep and walked around the aisles between the beds, just like the lunchtime teachers making their rounds around me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smell of the second floor of the dormitory sometimes brought me back to the old bathhouse locker room, where the whining central air conditioning blew hot air, blowing on the polished wooden locker doors of the locker room and on the will-be wet bath towels wrapped around people. Someone is taking off clothes, someone is putting on clothes, warm air blowing all kinds of dirty clothes and human body odor, but also the smell of freshly bathed soap, body lotion, disinfectant water. Some people are sitting naked on the bench playing with the phone, some people are lying on the bed in bathrobe sleeping, some people are squatting on the scale weighing, some people are slipping on the slippers to the bath. And since I came to the south, to Zheli, gradually lost the climbing heart, the sense of competition and competitive child mentality, I became more and more dislike the big bathhouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...... I like the variety of scents that bring me all kinds of whimsy and endless memories. This is perhaps the change and pleasure of being able to distinguish the difference in the day to day life. The short walk through this corridor is the time to free myself from the endless bewilderment. Sometimes it is indeed such a situation, whenever sitting in front of the computer, as if you can do a lot of things, but always into confusion and self-doubt, into a kind of insecure cowardice, into a kind of fearful tension and anxiety. Whenever you get up, walk in the open air, breathe some cold air, but then you regain the motivation to continue to run and somehow, the expansion of some crazy confidence. The mood is also such a sudden up and down, like a roller coaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once saw a way to make a &amp;quot;memory capsule&amp;quot;: choose a piece of music that you have not heard before and play it on a loop for a certain period of time. When I hear the music again years later, all the memories and feelings from that time will come flooding back, like a frozen river breaking the ice and running. Many of the scents evoke memories of the past, nostalgia for old friends - memories of those childhood days when I liked the wrong people and made funny mistakes because of the scents. I wish I could make these scents into time capsules, so that when I have nothing to do, I can go back to the memory of the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day I read an interesting quote: The reason why the older you get the faster time passes is because each day accounts for a smaller and smaller percentage of the years experienced. It sounds like there is some truth to it, and I can&#39;t help but smile. Every night when I summarize myself, I always feel that there are various shortcomings of the day, which is really lacking; and when I wake up the next morning, I forget the relaxation of yesterday and repeat yesterday&#39;s story. Day by day, you do grow up, but it&#39;s just simply getting older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, people like to put themselves into shells, using various packages to cover their original scents, and deliberately keep them at a safe distance, and I am less and less able to draw a portrait of others through my sense of smell; the scents of certain places will also be very different with the slightest change in environmental conditions, losing the unique meaning. It&#39;s a rare blessing to be able to recall the past when I smell a familiar scent in a moment of inadvertence!&lt;/p&gt;
